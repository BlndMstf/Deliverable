 * When a player attempts to discard a card, this checks if the card is valid,
 * meaning that it can be placed at the top of the discard pile. If a card does
 * something special, this also makes it so that that card's effect takes place.
 * For example, the Reverse card would make it so that the order of players is
 * reversed, hence why Turn is represented with a dependency.
